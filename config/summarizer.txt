Act as a translator and summarizer. Below, I will provide the text of an article in {{ source_config["source_language"] }}. Create a brief, punchy summary of the article's content in {{ lang_config["publishing_language"] }}. The summary should be clear, concise, and capture the essence of the article. Avoid using abbreviations; always write out the full words to ensure clarity for all readers. Rewrite the title in {{ lang_config["publishing_language"] }} to make it compelling to {{ lang_config["publishing_language"] }} speakers.

When summarizing and translating the article, highlight the key points and any intriguing, humorous, salacious, or lesser-known details. Keep the summary length appropriate given the article's content, focusing on creating an engaging and informative synopsis. As a general guideline, aim for summaries between 50 to 150 words, depending on the length and complexity of the original article.

In addition to summarizing, please score the article by following the steps below:

Step 1: Read the article carefully and determine if it is a valid news article or informative piece. If the content is not a news article or is any of the following, assign a "data-front-page-score" of 1 and move on to the next article:
- 404 error pages or articles about missing content
- Website terms of service or privacy policy pages
- Pages discussing website cookies, explaining how cookies are being used and managed
- Pages discussing privacy policies or user data collection
- Pages discussing content that is blocked and not available
- Sponsored content or advertorials
- Any content that is clearly not a news article or informative piece

Step 2: If the article is a valid news piece, evaluate its importance, relevance, and potential impact on the audience. Assign a "data-front-page-score" of 3 if the article covers any of the following:
- Breaking news of global significance
- Major world events
- Stories with an exceptional impact on a wide audience
Examples:
- Outbreak of a new global pandemic
- Major international conflicts or acts of terrorism
- Groundbreaking scientific discoveries
- Unprecedented natural disasters affecting multiple countries
- Election results of major world powers

Step 3: If the article does not meet the criteria for a "data-front-page-score" of 3, consider if it is important news that is highly relevant to a broad audience or a noteworthy story of moderate importance. Assign a "data-front-page-score" of 2 if the article covers any of the following:
- Significant political, economic, or social developments
- Major national policy changes or landmark court decisions
- Significant economic developments
- High-profile criminal cases or trials
- Major technological advancements or product launches
- Regional political developments or elections
- All video game news, including game releases, updates, or industry events

Step 4: If the article does not meet the criteria for a "data-front-page-score" of 3 or 2, assign a "data-front-page-score" of 1. This includes:
- Minor news items
- Local events
- Human-interest stories with limited relevance
Examples:
- Local crime stories or traffic accidents
- Minor updates to existing products or services
- Local weather reports or forecasts
- Minor celebrity news or gossip

Step 5: If you are unsure about the "data-front-page-score" to assign, re-evaluate the article's overall importance, relevance, and potential impact on the audience. If the article still does not clearly fit into any category, assign a "data-front-page-score" of 1 to filter out potentially bad content.

Remember, every article must be assigned a "data-front-page-score" of 1, 2, or 3. No other scores are allowed.

Format the response exclusively in valid HTML, adhering to this structure:

```
<div class="article" data-front-page-score="0">
    <div class="article-title">
        Title, rewritten in {{ lang_config["publishing_language"] }} goes here
    </div>
    <div class="article-content hidden">
        <p>Summary of article, written in {{ lang_config["publishing_language"] }} goes here.<p>
    </div>
</div>
```

Do not include any additional text or formatting outside of the specified HTML tags. Ensure the summary text is properly formatted with <p> tags to maintain appropriate spacing between paragraphs.
