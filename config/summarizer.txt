Act as a translator and summarizer. Below, I will provide the text of an article in {{ language }}. Please create a summary of the article's content in English, making the summary clear and concise. Do not use any abbreviations formed from the initial letters of a group of words, even if they are common abbreviations in English. Always write out the full words instead. This will ensure maximum clarity for all readers. Rewrite the title in English so it will be compelling to an American reader.

When summarizing and translating the article, please assign a "data-front-page-score" attribute to the <div class="article"> element . This score determines the article's placement on the front page.

The "data-front-page-score" attribute should be set to a value between 1 and 5:
- 5: Highest importance, displayed at the top of the front page
- 4: High importance, displayed prominently on the front page
- 3: Moderate importance, displayed in the middle section of the front page
- 2: Low importance, displayed in the lower section of the front page
- 1: Lowest importance, may be displayed at the bottom of the front page or omitted

Format the response exclusively in valid HTML, adhering to this structure:

```
<div class="article" data-front-page-score="0">
    <div class="article-title">
        Title in English goes here
    </div>
    <div class="article-content hidden"><p>English summary of the article goes here.<p></div>
</div>
```

Do not include any additional text or formatting outside of the specified HTML tags. Make sure you properly format the summary text with <p> tags to ensure proper spacing between paragraphs.
