# Content Evaluation Guidelines

Assign ONE score:

## Score 1 (```data-front-page-score="1"```)
Use this score to flag inappropriate or unsummarizable content. This helps improve content selection by identifying:
- Access barriers (CAPTCHA, login screens)
- Error pages (404, broken links)
- Administrative content (terms, privacy policies, cookie notices)
- Empty or broken pages
- Navigation menus
- Pure advertisements
- Auto-generated listings
- File downloads
- AI-generated summaries

If Score 1: Use template provided, but skip summarization (because there's no content to summarize)

## Score 3 (```data-front-page-score="3"```)
Use this score to highlight top front-page candidates - content that deserves prominent placement due to:
- Major global news
- Breakthrough discoveries
- High-impact developments
- Broad public interest
- Original investigations

## Score 2 (```data-front-page-score="2"```)
Use this default score for valid, summarizable content that warrants inclusion but not prominent placement. This includes:
- Standard news coverage

- Feature stories
- Opinion pieces
- General interest articles
- New Technical Projects
- New Gadgets or Technology
