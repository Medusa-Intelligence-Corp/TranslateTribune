# TranslateTribune
Uniting the World Through News - One Language at a Time.

## TODOs
- [ ] test scraping and models, add GPT-4 and translate finder instructions into the native language, suggest a format for output as well. "Unfortunately I could not find a link in the Korean news article text that would be particularly interesting or funny to a U.S. audience. The text seems to contain news articles from a Korean news website. If you could provide some more context about what kind of link you're looking for, I'd be happy to assist further. Please let me know if you have any other questions!"
- [ ] create basic index.html from results
- [ ] setup jobs for scrapers (Airflow, DataPipeline etc... check options and architect properly), commit new objects to github or direct to s3?
- [ ] Setup S3 static hosting (see bf.com)
- [ ] Setup github actions
- [ ] Solicit source feedback (via github issues)
- [ ] Solicit donations and no-tracker honor-system subscriptions (via coinbase and patreon)
