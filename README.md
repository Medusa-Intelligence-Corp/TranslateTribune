# TranslateTribune

Welcome to the source code for [https://TranslateTribune.com](https://translatetribune.com), a project dedicated to breaking down language barriers and providing a daily dose of global insights. Our mission is to curate and translate news from a broad array of countries, both friendly and hostile to the US, making international news accessible to English-speaking audiences.

## Motivation

In today's interconnected world, understanding global perspectives is more important than ever. However, language barriers often limit our access to diverse viewpoints and news sources. TranslateTribune aims to bridge this gap by using advanced AI technology to select, translate, and summarize news articles from around the world, providing a richer, more nuanced view of global events.

## How It Works

TranslateTribune leverages Claude 3 Opus, Python, Selenium WebDriver via Docker, and Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4) to:

- Scrape foreign language news sites from a wide range of countries.
- Use AI to pick relevant news articles.
- Translate and summarize these articles into English.

Our process ensures that you get accurate, concise summaries of international news, offering insights into how different cultures and countries report on similar events or issues.

## Features

- **Daily Updates:** Fresh news summaries every day, giving you a constant stream of global insights.
- **Diverse Sources:** Articles are selected from a variety of countries and perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded view of world events.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Quick, accurate translations and summaries powered by the latest AI technology.
- **Easy Access:** All summaries are available on our GitHub page, making it easy to stay informed.

## Sample Articles

Here are a few examples of the types of articles you can expect from TranslateTribune:

- **The Hazardous Paths of an Autonomy Promised Under Pressure** ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· *Le Figaro*
- **The Situation in Northern Gaza Reflects Lack of Clear Goals** ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± *Yedioth Ahronoth*

## Getting Started

To explore our project and start reading the summaries, visit our GitHub repository. We welcome feedback and contributions to help expand our coverage and improve our translations.

To run the scraper and generate an index.html to the console do the following:
* ```git clone``` this repo
* ```bash build.sh``` to build the docker container
* ```bash run.sh``` to run the curation and translation job

If you'd like to edit the code note the following structure:
* [```publisher.py```](./publisher.py) is the main loop that controls the job
* [```browser.py```](./browser.py) is how text is extracted from sites
* [```llm.py```](./llm.py) handles any LLM connections and formatting
* [```templater.py```](./templater.py) creates the index.html and deploys it to AWS s3

## Contributing

We're always looking for volunteers to help with:

- Identifying new sources to scrape.
- Improving our AI models for more accurate translations and summaries.
- Enhancing our web scraping capabilities.
