            <div class="section">
                <p>Welcome to TranslateTribune.com. This site is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that may be collected from you or that you may provide when visiting TranslateTribune.com and the practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>1. No Cookies</h2>
                <p>TranslateTribune.com does not use cookies for tracking purposes or for any other reason. The site is designed to respect your privacy by avoiding the use of cookies entirely.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>2. Minimal JavaScript Usage</h2>
                <p>TranslateTribune.com employs minimal JavaScript for essential functionality only: animating the title and providing accessibility features for screen readers. By limiting JavaScript to these basic functions, the site ensures that users maintain control over their browsing experience, reduces security vulnerabilities, and prevents unwanted code execution. This approach protects user privacy, improves page load times, and ensures the site remains functional even when JavaScript is disabled. The JavaScript code is kept simple, transparent, and serves only the user's interests rather than enabling tracking or data collection.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>3. Privacy-Respecting Native Advertisements</h2>
                <p>TranslateTribune.com implements a transparent and privacy-focused advertising approach. Advertisements are clearly marked and distinguishable from regular content. Advertising partnerships operate on a performance-based model, with compensation occurring only when users actively choose to sign up for or purchase advertised products. Most importantly, user privacy is protected by ensuring that no personal information is shared with advertisers, and they receive no data about who views their advertisements.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. No Trackers</h2>

            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>5. Server Logs Information</h2>
                <p>The only information indirectly collected is through essential server logs maintained by AWS and Cloudfront. These logs record basic details such as IP addresses, browser types, referring/exit pages, and timestamps, which are necessary for operational integrity, troubleshooting, and enhancing site security and performance. This process does not involve actively collecting or profiling personal information.</p>

However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
