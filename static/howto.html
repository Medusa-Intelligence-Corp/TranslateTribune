  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>Picross, also known as Nonograms, is a puzzle game where the goal is to fill in or cross out squares on a grid to reveal a hidden picture. Each row and column of the grid has numbers that indicate the lengths of the consecutive blocks of filled-in squares in that line. For example, a clue of "4 3" means there are sets of four and three filled squares, with at least one blank square between them.</p>
  <p>The player uses these clues to deduce which squares to fill in and which to leave blank, gradually uncovering the hidden image. It's a game of logic and deduction, requiring no guesswork if approached methodically.</p>
