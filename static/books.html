                  My Crazy Feminist Girlfriend by Min Ji Hyoung
                 </div>
                 <p class="article-content hidden">
                  "My Crazy Feminist Girlfriend" by Min Ji Hyoung is a thought-provoking story that explores the complex dynamics of a relationship between a man and his ex-girlfriend who has become a radical feminist. The story follows Kim Seung-joon as he reunites with his ex-girlfriend four years after their breakup, only to find that she has undergone a significant transformation. With her short hair, all-black attire, and active participation in feminist protests, Seung-joon's ex-girlfriend challenges his traditional views and forces him to confront the realities of issues such as sexual harassment, illegal filming, and abortion rights.

Throughout the story, Seung-joon struggles to understand and accept his girlfriend's feminist awakening, leading to tensions and arguments that ultimately drive them apart. Despite their differences, Seung-joon finds himself unable to move on, constantly thinking about his ex-girlfriend and the impact she has had on his life. The story concludes with a poignant scene at the airport, where Seung-joon's parents return from a trip as his ex-girlfriend departs for Iceland to write a book about the country's recent legalization of abortion. This final moment serves as a metaphor for the divergent paths their lives have taken and the realization that, while he may never fully understand her experiences, a part of him will always care for her deeply.

                  Ukraine - Russia: To Understand by Various Authors
                 </div>
                 <p class="article-content hidden">
                  This collective work aims to shed light on the complex relations between Ukraine and Russia, two countries with intertwined destinies. It addresses historical, political, and cultural aspects to better understand the current issues. The book helps deconstruct certain myths and provides a better understanding of Ukraine, a little-known country torn between Russian and European influences.

                 <p class="article-content hidden">
Ukraine and Russia have distinct historical origins, even though Russian propaganda has long sought to appropriate the heritage of Kievan Rus'. Ukraine suffered forced Sovietization, Russification, and tragedies like the Holodomor, the deadly great famine orchestrated by Stalin in 1932-33, which claimed millions of victims. The national poet Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861) is considered the father of the modern Ukrainian language and nation. Since independence in 1991, Ukraine has been seeking its path between East and West, with the Orange Revolution of 2004 and the Maidan uprising in 2013-2014 testifying to its democratic and European aspirations. Putin's Russia views this rapprochement with the West unfavorably, as illustrated by the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the conflict in Donbas.

                 Is It Good or Bad for You? A Manual for Food Self-Defense by Dario Bressanini
                 </div>
                 <p class="article-content hidden">
In "Fa bene o fa male? Manuale di autodifesa alimentare" (Is it good or bad for you? A manual for food self-defense), Italian chemist and science communicator Dario Bressanini aims to equip readers with the tools to navigate the often confusing and contradictory information about food and nutrition. Through a skeptical and scientific lens, he examines various food myths, fad diets, and marketing claims to separate fact from fiction. Bressanini covers a wide range of topics, including the supposed health benefits of chocolate, the carcinogenic risks of processed meats, misleading food labeling practices, the effectiveness of chlorophyll as a therapeutic agent, and the safety of tap water versus bottled water.
                 </p>
                 <p class="article-content hidden">
Throughout the book, Bressanini emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, evidence-based research, and the ability to distinguish between reliable scientific findings and sensationalized or misleading claims. He exposes the ways in which low-quality studies, p-hacking, and publication bias can distort our understanding of nutrition and health. While dispelling misconceptions, Bressanini also highlights the limits of nutritional epidemiology and the challenges of establishing causation. He advocates for improved science communication to the public and empowers readers to make more informed choices by being discerning consumers of both food and information. Rather than demonizing particular foods, he emphasizes the importance of moderation, variety, and an evidence-based approach to diet.
